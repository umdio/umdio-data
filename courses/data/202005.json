Themes of the course include, but are not limited to, theories and approaches to globalization, refugees, sexuality and family along the border, transnational families, gendered migrations, sweatshops, intimate labor, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).","grading_method":["Regular"],"gen_ed":[],"core":[],"relationships":{"coreqs":null,"prereqs":null,"formerly":null,"restrictions":null,"additional_info":null,"also_offered_as":"AMST498Z.","credit_granted_for":"USLT498X or AMST498Z."},"sections":[{"course":"AMST498Z","section_id":"AMST498Z-WB21","semester":"202005","number":"WB21","seats":"15","meetings":[{"days":"","room":"ONLINE","building":"","classtype":"","start_time":"","end_time":""},{"days":"","room":"ONLINE","building":"","classtype":"","start_time":"","end_time":""}],"open_seats":"8","waitlist":"0","instructors":["Jacqueline Partida"]}]},{"course_id":"AMST798","semester":"202005","name":"Non-Thesis Research","dept_id":"AMST","department":"American Studies","credits":"1","description":null,"grading_method":["Regular","Audit"],"gen_ed":[],"core":[],"relationships":{"coreqs":null,"prereqs":null,"formerly":null,"restrictions":null,"additional_info":null,"also_offered_as":null,"credit_granted_for":null},"sections":[]},{"course_id":"AMST799","semester":"202005","name":"Master's Thesis Research","dept_id":"AMST","department":"American Studies","credits":"1","description":null,"grading_method":["Regular"],"gen_ed":[],"core":[],"relationships":{"coreqs":null,"prereqs":null,"formerly":null,"restrictions":null,"additional_info":null,"also_offered_as":null,"credit_granted_for":null},"sections":[{"course":"AMST799","section_id":"AMST799-I101","semester":"202005","number":"I101","seats":"1","meetings":[{"days":"","room":"","building":"","classtype":"","start_time":"","end_time":""},{"days":"","room":"","building":"","classtype":"","start_time":"","end_time":""}],"open_seats":"1","waitlist":"0","instructors":["Psyche Williams-Forson"]},{"course":"AMST799","section_id":"AMST799-I201","semester":"202005","number":"I201","seats":"1","meetings":[{"days":"","room":"","building":"","classtype":"","start_time":"","end_time":""},{"days":"","room":"","building":"","classtype":"","start_time":"","end_time":""}],"open_seats":"1","waitlist":"0","instructors":["Psyche Williams-Forson"]}]},{"course_id":"AMST899","semester":"202005","name":"Doctoral Dissertation Research","dept_id":"AMST","department":"American Studies","credits":"1","description":null,"grading_method":["Regular"],"gen_ed":[],"core":[],"relationships":{"coreqs":null,"prereqs":null,"formerly":null,"restrictions":null,"additional_info":null,"also_offered_as":null,"credit_granted_for":null},"sections":[]},{"course_id":"AASP100","semester":"202005","name":"Introduction to African American Studies","dept_id":"AASP","department":"African American Studies","credits":"3","description":"Significant aspects of the history of African Americans with particular emphasis on the evolution and development of black communities from slavery to the present.

The impact of each of these decisions flows through the three financial statements and results in financial outcomes and ratios that measure the success of each team.

Themes of the course include, but are not limited to, theories and approaches to globalization, refugees, sexuality and family along the border, transnational families, gendered migrations, sweatshops, intimate labor, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).","grading_method":["Regular","Audit"],"gen_ed":[],"core":[],"relationships":{"coreqs":null,"prereqs":null,"formerly":null,"restrictions":null,"additional_info":null,"also_offered_as":"AMST498Z.","credit_granted_for":"USLT498X or AMST498Z."},"sections":[{"course":"USLT498X","section_id":"USLT498X-WB21","semester":"202005","number":"WB21","seats":"15","meetings":[{"days":"","room":"ONLINE","building":"","classtype":"","start_time":"","end_time":""},{"days":"","room":"ONLINE","building":"","classtype":"","start_time":"","end_time":""}],"open_seats":"8","waitlist":"0","instructors":["Jacqueline Partida"]}]},{"course_id":"WMST250","semester":"202005","name":"Introduction to Women's Studies:  Women, Art and Culture","dept_id":"WMST","department":"Women's Studies","credits":"3","description":"An examination of women's creative powers as expressed in selected examples of music, film, art, drama, poetry, fiction, and other literature.
